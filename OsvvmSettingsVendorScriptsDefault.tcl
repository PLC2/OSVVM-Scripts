# DO NOT CHANGE THESE SETTINGS
#   This file is overwritten with each new release.
#   These are also overridden by VendorScripts_vvv.tcl
#   Instead, create a OsvvmSettingsLocal.tcl and change them there.
#   If you do not have a OsvvmSettingsLocal.tcl, 
#   copy OsvvmSettingsLocal_example.tcl to OsvvmSettingsLocal.tcl

  # FunctionalCoverageIntegratedInSimulator controls whether osvvm.pro allows functional coverage to be linked into simulator interface
  #   osvvm.pro does:  analyze CoverageVendorApiPkg_${::osvvm::FunctionalCoverageIntegratedInSimulator}.vhd
  #   Currently valid values are:   
  #       "default" - do not use any simulator functional coverage linking.
  #       "Aldec"   - use the link for Aldec tools - works with RivieraPRO and ActiveHDL
  #       "NVC"     - works with NVC 1.15.1 or newer.
  #   Values other than "default" is set by VendorScripts_***.tcl for the respective simulator
  #   Here, if a value was not previously set, the value "default" will be set.
  #   To add capabilty to a simulator, 
  #      add a file named CoverageVendorApiPkg_<simualtor_or_vendor>.vhd to directory osvvm and 
  #      set this variable in the VendorScripts_***.tcl for the appropriate version of the simualtor (see VendorScripts_NVC.tcl)
