Create a Simulation directory
*****************************

Create a simulation directory. Generally I name this :file:`sim` or :file:`sim_vendor-name`. Creating a simulation
directory means that cleanup before running regressions is just a matter of deleting the sim directory and recreating a
new one.

The following assumes you have created a directory named :file:`sim` in the :file:`OsvvmLibraries` directory.

Alternately, you can run simulations out of the Scripts, but cleanup is a mess as a simulator tends to create numerous
temporaries.

Start the Script environment in the Simulator

Do the actions appropriate for your simulator.
